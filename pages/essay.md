This short essay explains what Wax is doing here and how each view supports different browsing needs:

- **Gallery** (thumbnail grid): quick visual scan, jump to items.
- **Table** (sortable/filterable): compare metadata at a glance.
- **Search** (keyword): jump directly via title/source/tags.
- **Tags** (facet): click a concept to group related items.
- **Item** (detail): large image, metadata, transcript/notes.
